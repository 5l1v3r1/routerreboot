# RouterReboot

Use Puppeteer to reboot the awful Huawei router in my sharehouse.

The poor little bugger isn't built to work with the number of WiFi clients that we have in this house, so it occasionally needs to be rebooted.

## Usage

### From NPX

```
npx routerreboot
```

### From repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ScriptSmith/routerreboot.git
cd routerreboot
npm install
sudo npm install -g
```

```
$ rr
 Launching
